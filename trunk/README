This project tunnels TCP data through a UDP tunnel. There are two executables:
udpserver and udpclient. The server acts as a proxy for the client, listening
on a specified UDP port and creating a connection to a TCP server that the
client specifies. The client listens on a TCP port, acting as the server that
some TCP client connects to. The client recevies any TCP data on that port and
sends the data to the udpserver, which sends it to the TCP connection it made
with the desired TCP server.


To run the udpserver:
    udpserver [-6] [host] port
where the port is a UDP port to listen for messages from the udpclient and host
is the address to listen on. Use the -6 option to listen on IPv6 addresses.
Examples: 
    udpserver 4444
    udpserver -6 ::1 4444


To run the udpclient:
    udpclient [-6] [local host] <local port> <proxy host> <proxy port>
            <remote host> <remote port>
local host/port - Host and port for the TCP server to listen on. If the host
                  isn't supplied, it will listen on all available addresses.
proxy host/port - Host and port that udpserver is listening on.
remote host/port - Host and port to forward the received TCP data to. The host
                   is relative to the proxy machine (e.g. specifiying 127.0.0.1
                   is the proxy machine itself).
Use the -6 option to listen and connect using IPv6 addresses.

Example for tunneling ssh data through the tunnel:
    udpclient 127.0.0.1 3333 192.168.1.1 4444 192.168.1.2 22
Assuming udpserver is running on 192.168.1.1:4444, "ssh -p 3333 localhost" will
connect you to the ssh server on 192.168.1.2 using the UDP tunnel through
192.168.1.1.

This code has been tested and works on Linux, Solaris 10 x86, and Cygwin (but
requires the IPv6 extension - http://win6.jp/Cygwin/index.html).
